# LINQ

More of the *what*, less of the *how*. Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
transforms the way you code by giving you the power of SQL and functional
programming with the comfort of C# or Visual Basic. Query anything from lists to
XML to databases. LINQ uses deferred execution to make sure your code is fast.
