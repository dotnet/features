# .NET is an open standard

The .NET platform is based on open standards.

There was a very early realization by the founders of .NET that they were
creating a new programming technology that had broad applicability across
operating systems and CPU types and that advanced the state of the art of late
1990s (when the .NET project started at Microsoft) programming language
implementation techniques. This led to considering and then pursuing
standardization as an important pillar of establishing .NET in the industry.

The key addition to the state of the art was support for multiple programming
languages with a single language runtime, hence the name Common Language
Runtime. There were many other smaller additions, such as value types, a simple
exception model and attributes. Generics and language integrated query were
later added to that list.

Looking back, standardization was quite effective, leading to .NET having a
strong presence on iOS and Android, with the Unity and Xamarin offerings, both
of which use the Mono runtime. The same may end up being true for .NET on Linux.

The various .NET standards have been made meaningful by the collaboration of
multiple companies and industry experts that have served on the working groups
that have defined the standards. In addition (and most importantly), the .NET
standards have been implemented by multiple commercial (ex: Unity IL2CPP, .NET
Native) and open source (ex: Mono) implementors. The presence of multiple
implementations proves the point of standardization.

.NET is based on the following ECMA standards:

* ECMA 334 - C#
* ECMA 335 - CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
* ECMA 372 - C++/CLI
