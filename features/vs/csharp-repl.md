# C\# REPL

The Interactive Window is back! The C# Interactive Window returns in Visual
Studio 2015 Update 1 along with a couple other interactive treats:

* **C# Interactive.** The C# Interactive window is essentially a
  read-eval-print-loop (REPL) that allows you to play and explore with .NET
  technologies while taking advantage of editor features like IntelliSense,
  syntax-coloring, etc. Learn more about how to use C# Interactive on Channel 9
  or by reading our beginner's walkthrough.
* **csi.** If you don't want to open Visual Studio to play around with C# or run
  a script file, you can access the interactive engine from the Developer
  Command Prompt. Type csi /path/myScript.csx to execute a script file or type
  simply csi to drop inside the command-line REPL.
* **Scripting APIs.** The Scripting APIs give you the ability to execute
  snippets of C# code in a host-created execution environment. You can learn
  more about how to create your own C# script engine by checking out our code
  samples.

For our VB folks, please note that the Visual Basic Interactive and Scripting
APIs are coming in the future.
