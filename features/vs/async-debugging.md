# Async Debugging

Async debugging in .NET is awesome. Infrastructure code has been folded into
External Code. In addition, logical parent frames are chained in the call stack
window. This allows for better causality analysis and diagnostics. For more
information, see the [Visual Studio blog post on this feature](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2013/07/01/debugging-asynchronous-code-in-visual-studio-2013-call-stack-enhancements.aspx).
