# Managed Return Values

Managed Return Values allow you to examine the result of a function call without
having to assign the function result to a local variable. This is especially
useful when the returned value is not stored in a local variable.

Return value(s) get displayed in the "Autos Windows" (Debug->Windows->Autos).
You can also use the pseudo variable "$ReturnValue" in the Watch and/or
Immediate window to fetch the last function's return value.
