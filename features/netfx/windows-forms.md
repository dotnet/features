# Windows Forms

Windows Forms is the first client app API that was included in .NET. It remains
quite popular. It is effectively a wrapper API over the Windows GDI+ API.
Windows forms enables developers to build graphically rich client applications,
that enable both network-connected and offline scenarios and that are easy to
deploy and update.

Windows Forms applications are sometimes deployed with the ClickOnce deployment
technology, which supports both intranet and internet deployment. ClickOnce was
introduced in the .NET Framework 2.0.
