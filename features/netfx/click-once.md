# ClickOnce

ClickOnce is a deployment technology that allows you to create self-updating
Windows-based applications that can be installed and run with minimal user
interaction. ClickOnce delivers three major features:

* **Low-friction installation:** ClickOnce deployment allows non-administrative
  users to install  applications.
* **Low-impact installation:** ClickOnce deployment treats each application as a
  self-contained unit, with the effect that ClickOnce installation does not
  affect other applications.
* **Ease of updating applications:** ClickOnce deployment allows you to provide
  updates to users automatically. It is easy to update all users to the new
  version of an application.

Windows client deployment challenges have caused many developers to create Web
applications rather than client applications, sacrificing rich Windows user
interface, responsiveness, offline capabilities and integration with native
Windows APIs (ex: COM, Win32). ClickOnce delivers a Windows client deployment
solution that shares characteristics with Web applications, while not giving up
on any of the richness of Windows.
