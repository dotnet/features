# Focus on Performance

ASP.NET Core bleeds performance.  Rather than give some marketing spin, here's
some numbers to look at:

* 1.15 million requests per second on a single machine.
* 12.6 Gbps throughput on a single machine.
* 21 total processes running on a machine with Windows Nano Server and ASP.NET Core.
* 10ms response time or lower.

And getting better every day.
