# Open Source

ASP.NET Core is open source and developed out in the open.  Interested in the
rationale behind certain things?  Now you can look at the history of the code,
and read the conversations and decisions made when something was built.  Want to
take part in shaping how things are built for the future?  You can engage with
us and suggest improvements.
