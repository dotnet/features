# Native Cross-Platform iOS, OS X, Android, and Windows Mobile

Xamarin allows you to seliver native Android, iOS, and
Windows apps, using existing skills,
teams, and code.

## Xamarin apps look and feel native because they are

***Native User Interfaces.***

Xamarin apps are built with standard, native user interface controls. Apps not
only look the way the end user expects, they behave that way too.

**Native API Access.**

Xamarin apps have access to the full spectrum of functionality exposed by the
underlying platform and device, including platform-specific capabilities like
iBeacons and Android Fragments.

**Native Performance.**

Xamarin apps leverage platform-specific hardware acceleration, and are compiled
for native performance. This can't be achieved with solutions that interpret
code at runtime.
