# Xamarin Studio on OS X

Build better apps for iOS and Android with Xamarin Studio.

### Code completion so good, apps practically write themselves.

Explore the expansive landscape of iOS, Android and OS X APIs simply by typing.
Quickly look up types, methods and discover API functionality without breaking
your train of thought.

### Publishing apps has never been simpler.

Package and distribute your apps to the App Store and Google Play directly
within Xamarin Studio. We also support distributing iOS apps over the air with
TestFlight. What are you waiting for? Share your amazing apps with the world.

### Many eyes make bugs shallow. Our debugger makes them extinct.

Bugs don't stand a chance with the full power of a modern debugger analyzing
their every move. Debug in a simulator or live on device. Set breakpoints, step
through code and watch values change during execution. Place your cursor over
variables in the editor for a live view of their data.

### One IDE. All of the devices.

In addition to mobile, the Xamarin Platform enables full support for smartwatch
apps. Apple WatchKit development is fully supported in Xamarin Studio,
augmenting Xamarin's existing wearable development support that includes 100%
API support for Android Wear and compatibility with Microsoft Band's C# SDK.
